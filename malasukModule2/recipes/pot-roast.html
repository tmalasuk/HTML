                    Pot roast is a quintessential comfort food that embodies the heartiness and warmth of home-cooked meals. This classic dish typically features a large cut of beef, most commonly a chuck roast, which is seasoned and seared before being slow-cooked with a medley of vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, and onions. The slow-cooking process allows the tough fibers of the meat to break down, resulting in a tender, flavorful roast that practically falls apart at the touch of a fork. The addition of beef broth, herbs, and sometimes a splash of red wine enhances the dish's depth of flavor, making it a favorite for family gatherings and special occasions.

                    <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
                    <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
                    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 275°F (135°C).</li>
                    <li>Sear the Roast: In a large Dutch oven or heavy pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the beef chuck roast generously with salt and pepper. Once the oil is hot, add the roast and sear it on all sides until browned, about 4-5 minutes per side. Remove the roast from the pot and set it aside.</li>
                    <li>Sauté the Aromatics: In the same pot, add the chopped onion and sauté for about 3-4 minutes until softened. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Deglaze the Pot: Pour in about 1 cup of beef broth, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits. This adds flavor to the dish.</li>
                    <li>Add Remaining Ingredients: Return the seared roast to the pot. Add the remaining beef broth, carrots, potatoes, celery, tomato paste, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves. Stir gently to combine.</li>
                    <li>Cook the Pot Roast: Cover the pot with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven. Cook for about 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat is tender and easily pulls apart with a fork.</li>
                    <li>Serve: Once cooked, remove the pot from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes. Discard the bay leaves before serving. Slice the pot roast and serve it with the vegetables and broth for a hearty meal.</li>
