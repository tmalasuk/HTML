                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cook the Potatoes: Begin by washing the potatoes thoroughly. Cut them into evenly sized chunks (about 1 to 2 inches) to ensure even cooking. Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover them with cold water. Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until the potatoes are fork-tender but not mushy.</li>
                    <li>Drain and Cool: Once cooked, drain the potatoes in a colander and let them cool for about 10 minutes. Allowing them to cool slightly helps prevent the mayonnaise from separating when mixed.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Dressing: In a large mixing bowl, combine the mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, apple cider vinegar, salt, and black pepper. Mix well until smooth and creamy.</li>
                    <li>Combine Ingredients: Once the potatoes have cooled, gently fold them into the dressing, ensuring they are well coated. Add the chopped celery, red onion, and hard-boiled eggs (if using) to the mixture, stirring gently to combine without mashing the potatoes.</li>
                    <li>Chill and Serve: Cover the potato salad and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld. Before serving, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Garnish with fresh dill or parsley, if desired.</li>
