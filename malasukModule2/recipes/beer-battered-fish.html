                    Beer-battered fish is a delightful dish that features fresh fish fillets coated in a light, crispy batter made from flour and beer, resulting in a flavorful and satisfying meal. The batter, often infused with seasonings like garlic powder and paprika, creates a golden, crunchy exterior that perfectly complements the tender, flaky fish inside. This dish is commonly associated with classic pub fare and is a popular choice for fish and chips, often served alongside crispy fries and tangy tartar sauce. The use of beer not only enhances the flavor of the batter but also contributes to its airy texture, making it a favorite among seafood lovers. Whether enjoyed at a seaside restaurant or prepared at home, beer-battered fish embodies the essence of comfort food, bringing warmth and satisfaction to any dining experience.

                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound white fish fillets</li>
                    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (plus more for dusting)</li>
                    <li>1 cup cold beer (lager or pale ale recommended)</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>

                <h3>Instructions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pat the fish fillets dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture. Cut them into pieces about 3 inches long for even cooking. Lightly dust the fillets with flour, shaking off any excess.</li>
                    <li> In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Gradually whisk in the cold beer until the batter is smooth and well combined. The batter should be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
                    <li>In a deep skillet or pot, pour in enough oil to reach a depth of about 2 inches. Heat the oil over medium-high heat until it reaches 375°F (190°C). You can test the oil by dropping a small amount of batter into it; if it sizzles and rises to the surface, the oil is ready.</li>
                    <li>Dip each piece of fish into the batter, allowing any excess to drip off. Carefully place the battered fish into the hot oil, cooking in batches to avoid overcrowding. Fry for about 3-4 minutes on each side, or until the batter is golden brown and crispy. Use tongs to turn the fish halfway through cooking.</li>
                    <li>Once cooked, remove the fish from the oil and place it on a wire rack or paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve hot with tartar sauce, lemon wedges, and your favorite sides.</li>
